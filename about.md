I'm <span>Zhejian Zhao</span>. Some people may think this name is tricky to pronounce, so you can just call me <span>Jerry</span>. 

I was born in Harbin, a beatiful city of northeastern China. I spent my high school days in Harbin No.3 High School and I got my bachelor degree in Tianjin University in 2015. In the next two years, I was a M.Eng student in Electrical and Computer Department of Queen's University.

I love music. I used to play electric keyboard and learned a little guitar and ukulele. I love sports. I a good swimmer and a not so good basketball player.

And now, I'm ready to code the world.
