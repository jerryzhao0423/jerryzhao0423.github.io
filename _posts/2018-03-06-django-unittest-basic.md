Recently, I have been told to learn things about the django unit test to write testing files, so that my recently referral system can be tested and make sure it works. I knew nothing about unit test before, and I tried to find my answer on the official website. Fortunately, Django official (<a href=https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial05/>Writing your first Django app, part 5</a>) provide a great tutorial for a beginner. And here is some points I think will be beneficial to someone knows nothing about unit test before.
