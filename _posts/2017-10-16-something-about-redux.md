<h2>Some points about redux</h2>

<p>Lately, I have been coding using react/redux. When I read an article about redux, I found some interesting points I should notice earlier.</p><br/>

<h3>First, you may don't need redux at all</h3>

<p>Redux is a pretty useful framework, but you don't have to use it. In fact, most of the time you just need React. Someone used to say this:</p>

```markdown
If you don't know whether you need Redux, then you don't need it.
```

<p>Also, the author of Redux, Dan Abramov once said:</p>

```markdown
You might not need Redux.
Donâ€™t use Redux unless you *tried* local component state and were dissatisfied. 
```
